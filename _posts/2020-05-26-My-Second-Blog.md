### Everyone in this course had some programming experience coming in (due to the prerequisites).  What are your thoughts on R vs whatever other software you've used?  What functionality do you like about R?  What parts do you miss about your other language?  Do you consider R a difficult language to learn? (If you knew R prior to the course, describe your experience when first learning it.)


I love data mining and data science, I experienced the work from academic research to Quantitative model developer, the tools I used also had multiple choices. 

The tools I used included:
<ol>
<li>Data analysis tools: Python, R, SAS, Hadoop applications(Pig, Scala, Hive, Spark)</li>
<li>Database and data storage: MS SQL, LiteSQL, Hadoop HDFS, Teradata, Oracle, Excel</li>
<li>Data mining: Weka, Java</li>
</ol>

Among those tools and applications, I personally love Python and R the most, here in this blog, let me compare the three tools that I use most frequently in my daily life.

*Python:*
Python is an open source programming language. Python repository can be updated by software developers, statisticians, data scientists, etc. The packages are covering almost all the perspective of the real world that I can think about. Python has simple syntax requirement that easy to learn. Python can also have the interactive console for easy data exploration. Now we have multiple stable and mature IDE to implement the Python programs, like Anaconda platform(Spyder, Jupyter), Eclipse, Atom and many other choices, so we can decide which IDE we’d like depends on the needs of the project. Python   has also have the functionality of the standard software programming languages, so we can develop the  software with UI and applications with Python. This flexibility can not be implemented by SAS and R.

Python also has some perspectives, which are not as strong as SAS and R. Python’s plotting function is not strong as R’s, though the programmers are working diligently to improve the matplot library. Python’s statistical procedures are not secured as SAS, so Python are not suitable to industrial like Pharmaceutical companies because of the open source and lace of the affirmation.

R:
R is pretty similar to Python, it is my second favorite programming language. I especially love the markdown and the flexible HTML output, which is fancy and suitable for reporting and presenting. 

R’s IDE have not much good productions like Python, but Rstudio is neat layout and stability. Meanwhile, R packages installations may encounter errors, that mainly because of the more complicated configuration of system.  R can almost cover almost all of the functionalities that SAS have.

SAS:
I use SAS about 10% of time of my work, I have re-wrote almost all of my code into Python and R. I work in a financial company, so my work doesn’t require high standard of statistical analysis, we don’t have to use SAS. But why should I still use SAS? Some of our projects require us to explore large number of datasets ~50 data sets and 1G each dataset. When we have cleaned SAS dataset that have been prepared before, the exploration will be easier than Python, R’s , we can access the sas datasets easier and faster.

SAS is not easy as Python to learn, and the most important thing: IT IS EXPENSIVE!
