### what (if anything) has changed about what you think a data scientist is and what they do
Data scientists has knowledge of statistic methods, data mining and other modeling domains, handle data set, use proficient software engineerâ€™s skills to manipulate the data set, in order to extract the knowledge from the data or develop property model for simulating or predicting. With the network of the knowledge discovered from data and the common sense, data scientists develop the predictive models to simulate the reality, which is the way of our real world scientists providing the predictions that will happen in the future.
<br />
The way of developing models can be traditional statistical methodologies or machine learning methodologies. Both ways work and can be benchmarks to each other.

### what your current thoughts are in terms of using R for data science - do you think you'll continue to use R going forward?  Why or why not?
I really like Rmarkdown and shiny with R for data science study. It provides fantastic way of presenting the R results as well as the code. Going forward, I will use R as my primary programming language, I will still keep using Python along with R. Because Python is more like a standard objective oriented programming language compare to R, will be easier to implement the applications.

### what things are you going to do differently in practice now that you've had this course?
There are only a few difference. In practice, when we develop the linear regression model, we have strict standard rules. The most important one is to make sure the model satistified the assumptions and they have property calculated values. In this course, we mainly focus on model implementation. 
Those are for my work, but for my personal study, Wow, I have a lot of modeling ideas!! I'm very interested in machine learning models, so going forward, will try to establish a human detection model for videos.
