In this project, I used the wine data (both the red and white wine data), and try to use the predictors fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol to predict the quality of wine (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10).
<br />
You can find my code in [github](https://github.com/mhe8/st558_project3), and run the runGitHub('st558_project3','mhe8') from rStudio to load the shiny app.

<br />
This data contains a set of observations on a number of red and white wine varieties from the Vinho Verde region in Portugal.

<br />
I used the KNN, multinomial and ridge regression as supervised methods. And the PCA were used as the unsupervised method. The app give the user the capability to expore the data and predict the wine quality by entering the input predictors.

<br />
When use the KNN and Multinomial, the quality was treated as categorical variable, and the confusion matrix will be provided for the testing data, the user can decide which predictors will be used. While for the ridge regression, Cross Validation was used to determine the lamdba for coefficient panelty.
