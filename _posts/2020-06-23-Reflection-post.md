How is the course going so far?  
* The half of the course has been completed, I have enjoyed the content of the course. Dr. Post explains the concepts and methods in very clear way.
* There a lot of excises, I think they are necessary, because it is very important to practice the idea of the methods and will be helpful in our daily work.
What do you like about the course and what would you change about the course?
* I appreciate the opportunity to learn R here, I have certainly gained a lot knowledge.
* The only thing I don't like is the Github part. I personally don't use Github, I have get used to other repository tools, I thought the Github can be optional study part but not the required content, and meanwhile, if you can introduce more repository tools to us will be even perfect to us.:)
* All in all, nothing to complain, it's worth to spent the time here.
Any other thoughts?  (I just like to hear how everyone is doing and get feedback to incorporate!
